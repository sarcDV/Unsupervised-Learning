# Unsupervised-Learning

Unsupervised models are machine learning algorithms that learn patterns 
from untagged data without human intervention. 
This repository is a simple collection of examples.
Here there are presented few common unsupervised models:

- Clustering models: These models group similar data points together based on their features. Examples are K-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering.
- Association models: These models discover rules that describe how often different items occur together in a data set. Examples are Apriori and FP-growth.
- Dimensionality reduction models: These models reduce the number of features in a data set while preserving the essential information. Examples are Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Autoencoders.
- Network models: Hopfield, Boltzmann, RBM, Stacked Boltzmann, Helmholtz, Variational Autoencoder, Self-organizing-map (SOM)
