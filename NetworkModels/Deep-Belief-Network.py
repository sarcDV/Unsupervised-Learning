"""
A deep belief network (DBN) is a type of artificial neural network that can learn 
the probability distribution of a set of data. 
It consists of multiple layers of hidden units, where each layer is a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). 
An RBM has connections only between visible and hidden units, but not within the same layer. 
A DBN can be trained using layerwise pre-training, where each RBM is trained separately and then stacked together. 
Here is a code block that shows how to define a DBN using PyTorch:
