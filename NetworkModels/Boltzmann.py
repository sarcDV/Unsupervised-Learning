"""
A Boltzmann machine is a type of artificial neural network that can learn the probability distribution of a set of data. 
It consists of visible units that represent the data and hidden units that capture the dependencies among the data. 
A simple Boltzmann machine has connections between every pair of units, but this makes it difficult to train and scale.
