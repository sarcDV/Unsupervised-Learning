"""
A variational autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model that learns a 
latent representation of the data and can generate new samples from it. 

A VAE consists of two parts: 
    an encoder that maps the input data to a latent distribution, 
    and a decoder that reconstructs the input data from a sample of the latent distribution.

One way to implement VAEs in Python with PyTorch is to use the torch.nn module 
to define the network architecture and the torch.optim module to perform gradient-based optimization. 
Here is a code block that shows an example of a VAE class that can be trained on the MNIST dataset:
